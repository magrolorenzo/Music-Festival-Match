# API methods
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/api-methods



## What does the Musixmatch API do?

The Musixmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.

**Note: all these methods require authentication.**

To make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the **API request** and **API response** in all the available output formats for each API call.
If you see certain fields in the responses which are not documented/not present in the examples, such data are not to be used.

Supported input parameters can be found in the input parameters section. Use `UTF-8` to encode arguments when calling API methods.

Also, every response includes a `status_code`. A list of all status codes can be consulted below in the status codes section.

<Tip>
  **Do you have an idea or suggestion for an API call that you don’t see here?**\
  Write us at [sales@musixmatch.com](mailto:sales@musixmatch.com) and we’ll do our best to respond!

# track.lyrics.analysis.search
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/api-reference/analysis/track-lyrics-analysis-search

post /ws/1.1/track.lyrics.analysis.search
Search tracks by lyrics analysis criteria — moods, themes, meaning, entities, moderation, rating, and more. Discover music based on what songs are about rather than just metadata like title or artist.

Search tracks by lyrics analysis criteria — moods, themes, meaning, entities, moderation, rating, and more.

This endpoint enables analysis-driven discovery: find songs about specific topics, with certain moods, mentioning particular entities, or matching content safety criteria. Search parameters are passed in the request body under a `data` key, while pagination is controlled via query parameters.

For detailed information about the analysis metadata returned in the response, please refer to the [Analysis documentation](/api-reference/analysis/analysis-overview).

## Input Constraints

* **Maximum string length**: 500 characters (`meaning`, `themes[]`, `genre[]`, `entities[].name`)
* **Maximum array size**: 20 items (`themes`, `entities`, `genre`, `moods`, `religions`, `moderation_categories`)

## Entities

The `entities` parameter accepts an array of objects. Each object must have at least one of `name` or `category`.

* Fields **within** an object are AND-ed (e.g. name=Paris AND category=Geographical Locations)
* **Multiple** objects are OR-ed (e.g. Paris OR London)

## Available Moods

Love, Heartbreak, Joy, Empowerment, Angst, Reflection, Inspiration, Nostalgia, Despair, Celebration, Anger, Peace, Solitude, Adventure, Social Commentary, Hope, Spirituality, Freedom, Party, Nature

## Rating Values

| Value | Description                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| G     | General audiences                              |
| PG    | Parental guidance suggested                    |
| PG-13 | Parents strongly cautioned (includes G and PG) |
| R     | Restricted (includes G, PG, and PG-13)         |
| NC-17 | Adults only (includes all)                     |

Rating is **hierarchical** — filtering by `PG-13` returns tracks rated G, PG, and PG-13.

## Entity Categories

People & Groups, Geographical Locations, Events & Periods, Cultural Works, Organizations & Institutions, Products & Brands, Concepts & Ideas, Diseases

## Religions

The `religions` parameter accepts an array of **strings** (religion names). Use `exclude_religions: true` to exclude tracks with any religious references instead.

The `moderation_categories` parameter accepts an array of **strings** (category names).

Available categories: `harassment`, `hate`, `illicit`, `sexual`, `violence`, `harassment/threatening`, `hate/threatening`, `illicit/violent`, `self-harm/intent`, `self-harm/instructions`, `self-harm`, `sexual/minors`, `violence/graphic`

```json theme={null}
"moderation_categories": ["violence"]
```

A request combining multiple parameters:

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "meaning": "songs about overcoming personal struggles and finding inner strength after loss",
    "moods": ["Empowerment", "Reflection", "Hope"],

    "first_release_date": "20200101",
    "needs_moderation": false,
    "lyrics_explicit": false
  }
}
```

# Lyric Fingerprint API
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/api-reference/fingerprint/fingerprint-overview



The Lyric Fingerprint API uses its comprehensive database of millions of lyrics and advanced search technology to provide a powerful text-matching service. This enables platforms to **detect potential copyrighted musical material** at scale.

<Callout icon="circle-chevron-right">
  Want to integrate Lyric Fingerprint API into your app? [Contact us](mailto:apisupport@musixmatch.com?subject=Sentinel%20integration%20request)
</Callout>

In today's generative AI landscape, platforms face the critical challenge of identifying copyrighted material in user-generated text. Lyric Fingerprint acts as a key component, allowing platforms to proactively flag potential copyright concerns and significantly strengthen their compliance strategies. More information on the [Sentinel website](https://sentinel.musixmatch.com?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=web\&utm_content=site_link).

Through a simple `POST` request to the `track.lyrics.fingerprint.post` endpoint, developers can submit any text containing at least 10 words and receive a ranked list of matching tracks from the Musixmatch catalog. The `size` parameter impacts the API performance and latency. It controls the number of candidate lyrics retrieved for comparison against your input. It is set to 10 by default with a maximum of 20, allowing platforms to balance between detection accuracy and processing efficiency. The `limit` parameter defines how many of the top matching tracks to return in the response.

```JSON theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "text": "Was dressed to the nines And we were dancing, dancing Like we're made of starlight, starlight nLike we're made of starlight, starlight"
  }
}
```

> Each `track` response property includes detailed metadata about the matched track, such as `track_name`, `artist_name`, `album_name` and `primary_genres`. The same data you would get from a `track.get` endpoint. The `similarity` score instead, indicates how closely the input text matches the lyrics of the track, with higher values representing a closer match.

* Read the [API Terms of Services](https://about.musixmatch.com/apiterms) to be sure your application complies
* Check your API call limits in order to match the expected traffic
* Handle `UTF-8` encoding in your pages required to display Musixmatch lyrics
* Show the value of `lyrics_copyright` you received from [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get) whenever you display lyrics in a page
* Implement the [country restrictions](/content-restrictions) you receive within every copyrighted content
* Add the [lyrics tracking script](/lyrics-views-tracking) to count the lyrics visualisations when using [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get)
* Add the "Lyrics powered by" image [provided by Musixmatch](https://about.musixmatch.com/brand-resources) and link it to the `backlink_url` field received from [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get)
* Disable the “copy and paste” function of web traffic from Japan


# Content Restrictions
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/content-restrictions



<Info>This page is written for the users of the non-enterprise plans. Information on restrictions for the Enterprise plan can be found [here](/enterprises/content-restrictions).</Info>

Restrictions on content are applied for a number of reasons; however, it all comes down to preserving copyright owners and preventing legal queries.

Within every API response that includes certain track-related content (e.g., lyrics or subtitles) we will provide information whether it is restricted or not. When we are not authorized to display certain content, we will not display it (e.g., lyrics body or subtitle body) in the endpoint’s response and will mark it as restricted. Where suitable, we will provide an appropriate message of not being authorized to show the lyrics.

This behaviour is applied to **three distinct cases**:

* An artist is restricted
* A single track is restricted worldwide
* A single track is restricted in a specific country (or countries)

## Examples

#### 1. Matcher.track.get for the track “Only Shallow” by My Bloody Valentine.

The artist is restricted worldwide.

# Authentication
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/enterprises/authentication

OAuth 2.0 integration guide for Musixmatch enterprise partners

Musixmatch enterprise integrations use **OAuth 2.0** for authentication and authorization. Two grant types are supported depending on your use case.

The authorization server base URL is:

```
https://connect.musixmatch.com
```

| Endpoint                                      | Description                |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `GET /oauth/authorize`                        | Authorization endpoint     |
| `POST /oauth/token`                           | Token issuance and refresh |
| `POST /oauth/token-metadata`                  | Token introspection        |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | OAuth 2.0 metadata         |
| `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration`       | OpenID Connect metadata    |

## Client Registration

Before integrating, Musixmatch will issue you a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** during the client registration process. You will also need to provide your `redirect_uri` (required for the Authorization Code flow).

Contact [apisupport@musixmatch.com](mailto:apisupport@musixmatch.com) to begin registration.

## Authorization Code Flow

Use this flow to authenticate end users (artists or rights holders) within your application. The result is an `access_token` bound to that user, which can be introspected to retrieve their Musixmatch user ID.

### Step 1 — Initiate the authorization request

Redirect the user to the Musixmatch authorization endpoint:

```
GET https://connect.musixmatch.com/oauth/authorize
```

| Parameter               | Required    | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `response_type`         | Yes         | Must be `code`                                          |
| `client_id`             | Yes         | Your client identifier                                  |
| `redirect_uri`          | Yes         | Your pre-registered callback URL                        |
| `scope`                 | Yes         | Must include `profile email`                            |
| `state`                 | Yes         | Random value to prevent CSRF — verify it on callback    |
| `code_challenge`        | Recommended | Base64url-encoded SHA256 hash of `code_verifier` (PKCE) |
| `code_challenge_method` | Recommended | Must be `S256` if using PKCE                            |

### Step 2 — User authorizes

The user logs in or registers on Musixmatch. On success, they are redirected to your `redirect_uri` with:

* `code` — the authorization code
* `state` — must match the value you sent in Step 1

### Step 3 — Exchange the code for tokens

```
POST https://connect.musixmatch.com/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

| Parameter       | Required     | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`    | Yes          | Must be `authorization_code`                                   |
| `client_id`     | Yes          | Your client identifier                                         |
| `client_secret` | Yes          | Your client secret                                             |
| `code`          | Yes          | The authorization code from Step 2                             |
| `redirect_uri`  | Yes          | Must exactly match the URI used in Step 1                      |
| `code_verifier` | If PKCE used | The original unhashed secret used to generate `code_challenge` |

**Response:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "scope": "profile email"
}
```

### Step 4 — Refresh the access token

When the `access_token` expires, use the `refresh_token` to get a new one without requiring the user to log in again.

```
POST https://connect.musixmatch.com/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

| Parameter       | Required | Description                   |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `grant_type`    | Yes      | Must be `refresh_token`       |
| `refresh_token` | Yes      | The refresh token from Step 3 |
| `client_id`     | Yes      | Your client identifier        |
| `client_secret` | Yes      | Your client secret            |

<Warning>
  Following the OAuth specification and security best practices, the `refresh_token` used in a successful request will be invalidated — alongside all related access tokens — and a new one will be issued in the response. Always store and use the latest `refresh_token` returned.
</Warning>

## Retrieving the Musixmatch User ID

Once you have a user `access_token`, introspect it to retrieve the Musixmatch user ID (`sub`). This ID is required when making API calls on behalf of a user.

```
POST https://connect.musixmatch.com/oauth/token-metadata
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

| Parameter     | Required | Description             |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `accessToken` | Yes      | The user's access token |

**Response (valid token):**

```json theme={null}
{
  "active": true,
  "sub": "<musixmatch-user-id>"
}
```

**Response (invalid token):**

```json theme={null}
{
  "active": false
}
```

## Client Credentials Flow

Use this flow for server-to-server API calls that do not require a user context — for example, submitting a release delivery or lyrics from your backend.

```
POST https://connect.musixmatch.com/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

| Parameter       | Required | Description                                   |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`    | Yes      | Must be `client_credentials`                  |
| `client_id`     | Yes      | Your client identifier                        |
| `client_secret` | Yes      | Your client secret                            |
| `scope`         | No       | Space-separated list of requested permissions |

**Response:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "..."
}
```

Pass the resulting `access_token` as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```


# Catalog Feed integration
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/enterprises/catalog-feed/overview

Download a complete copy of the Musixmatch music database for offline access

This documentation provides technical guidance for integrating Musixmatch’s music metadata into your product. The feed delivers various music-related metadata, including lyrics, writing credits, translations, mood information, and the structural breakdown of tracks.

Additionally, it describes the data delivery process, which includes weekly full feeds and daily incremental updates. This document outlines how to interpret and use each section of the data to enrich your product experience.
Note that, depending on the contractual agreement between Musixmatch and the client accessing the feed, some of the information described here might not be available to the client.

## Feed Structure Overview

The metadata feed contains multiple elements such as lyrics, song credits, translations, mood data, and song structure. The feed is delivered in two main ways:

* **Full feed**: A complete data feed delivered once a week.
* **Incremental updates**: Daily updates containing changes that have occurred since the last full feed.

These deliveries allow your system to stay up-to-date with minimal overhead by consuming only the necessary updates daily, while having access to the full dataset on a weekly basis.

Each item in the feed is delivered in a JSON format and has the following structure:

```json theme={null}
{
  "commontrack_id": 123456, //internal Musixmatch track id
  "lyrics_id": 456789, //internal Musixmatch lyrics id
  "isrcs": ["USUV12345678"], //ISRC ids associated to the track,
  "language_iso_code_1": "en",
  "explicit": true, //boolean flag for if the track contains explicit lyrics
  "instrumental": false, //boolean flag for if the track is instrumental or not
  "title": "Track Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "lyrics": "First lyrics line\nSecond lyrics line\nEtc.",
  "snippet": "Most relevant lyrics line of the song",
  "syncs": [], //array of line by line time synced lyrics
  "richsyncs": [], //array of word by word time synced lyrics
  "writers": [], //array of songwriters information
  "translations": [], //array of lyrics translations in multiple languages
  "metadata": {
    "mood_list": [], //array of song moods
    "structure": {}, //song structure information
  },
  "performers": [], //array of song's performers
  "genre": [], //array of the song's genres
  "restrictions": {}, //regional restrictions rules for displaying lyrics
  "restricted": {}, //boolean flag for if the display of lyrics is restricted worldwide
}
```

## Detailed Feed Sections

### Lyrics

The lyrics section provides full-text lyrics of a song, including information about explicit content, language, and the structure of time-synchronized lyrics.

* **Full Lyrics**: The complete text of the lyrics in the song. This is typically provided as a single string and may include markers for explicit language. Example:

```json theme={null}
“lyrics”: “First lyrics line\nSecond lyrics line\nEtc.”
```

* **Line by line Time-Synchronized Lyrics (Syncs)**: Time-coded lyrics aligned with specific moments in the song. Each entry in the synchronization list will provide the start time in milliseconds and the corresponding lyric. Example:

```json theme={null}
"syncs": [
  {
    "id": 123456,
    “body”: [
      {
        “start_milliseconds”: 230,
        “lyric”: “First lyrics line”
      },
      {
        “start_milliseconds”: 3670,
        “lyric”: “Second lyrics line”
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

* **Word by word Time-Synchronized Lyrics (Rich Syncs)**: In addition to the line by line synchronisation, with this format we provide also specific timing for each word in a lyrics line. Example:

```json theme={null}
"richsyncs": [
  {
    "id": 7852411,
    "body": [
      {
        "ts": 3.2, //start time of the line in seconds
        "te": 3.73, //end time of the line in seconds
        "l": [
          {
            "c": "First", // word
            "o": 0 // offset time from the line's start time in seconds
          },
          {
            "c": " ",
            "o": 0.105

### Mood

The mood section describes the emotional tone or atmosphere of a track. The feed outputs a selection of 5 most relevant moods for a track from a pool of 25 possible mood labels. Each of the 5 moods is given a value between 0 and 1 defining the amount of the respective mood present in the song.

List of all possible labels:

* peaceful

```json theme={null}
"mood_list": [
  {
    "label": "sensual",
    "value": 0.22
  },
  {
    "label": "empowering",
    "value": 0.116
  },
  {
    "label": "fiery",
    "value": 0.115

    "value": 0.078
  },
  {
    "label": "sophisticated",
    "value": 0.059
  }
]
```

### Structure

Musixmatch provides a breakdown of the structural elements of a track, such as verses, choruses, bridges, and more. This detailed information allows for deeper insights into the composition of the song.

Sections: A breakdown of each structural element of the track (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge).

* **Intro**: The Intro comes at the beginning and introduces the song. It may also introduce the performers by name, especially in rap songs‍.
  This tag is used for labelling the lyrical introduction to a track and not to be confused with the instrumental part at the begging of a track.
* **Hook**: The Hook is the catchiest part of a song - the bit that usually sticks with the listener. Not to be confused with the Chorus as it’s often more repetitive and a little less melodic.
* **Verse**: The Verse is the bit of a song that is the most narrative. It tells the story and is usually a little less memorable and catchy than the Chorus or Hook.
  When two or more sections of the song have almost identical melodies but different lyrics, you can consider each section one verse.
* **Pre-chorus**: This is the linking section between the Verse and the Chorus.
  Not every song has a distinct Pre-chorus, but if it’s there it’s usually distinguished from the verses by a change in the melody or the instrumentation.
* **Chorus**: This is most likely the bit the song is famous for.
  It is repeated throughout the song, usually without changes to the melody or lyrics.
  It often contains the song title.
* **Bridge**: The Bridge commonly comes about 60% of the way through the song and often introduces new melodic and lyrical ideas before a final repetition of the Chorus.
  It does sometimes, however, ‘re-imagine’ a Verse or the Chorus - maybe presenting the same lyrics with different instrumentation to spice it up a bit.
* **Outro**: The Outro takes a song to its conclusion - always coming at the very end of the track‍.
  As the Intro is used just at the beginning of the track, the Outro is used only at the end.

Example:

```json theme={null}
"structure": {
  "intro": {
    "lines": [0] //array of indexes of the lyric lines that make part of the specifc song section
  },
  "verse": {
    "lines": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
  },
  "chorus": {
    "lines": [9, 10, 11, 12, 32, 33, 34, 35]
  },
  "hook": {
    "lines": [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
  },
  "pre-chorus": {
    "lines": [28, 29, 30, 31]
  },
  "outro": {
    "lines": [36, 37, 38]
  }
}
```

### Performers

The **performers** section provides information on the artists performing the song, when available. The data is a breakdown of the lyrics with each part(snippet) having associated one or more performers and in some cases the performer can also be unknown. The performer object contains the type and an id to an external artist entity (such as a Spotify artist id).

Example:

```json theme={null}
"performers": [
  {
    "snippet": "Lorem ipsum\n",
    "performers": [
      {
        "type": "unknown"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "snippet": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\nPellentesque vestibulum elit id ultricies consequat.\n",
    "performers": [
      {
        "type": "artist",
        "fqid": "mxm:artist:XXXXXXX"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "snippet": "Maecenas eget augue vel est egestas commodo vitae eu tortor./nDonec mollis mi eget lorem aliquet, et bibendum elit rhoncus./n",
    "performers": [
      {
        "type": "artist",
        "fqid": "mxm:artist:XXXXXXX"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "snippet": "Donec gravida nibh lacinia odio tincidunt, in mattis mauris aliquet./nProin in lacus mollis, vulputate nunc vitae, ornare lorem./n",
    "performers": [
      {
        "type": "artist",
        "fqid": "mxm:artist:XXXXXXX"
      },
      {
        "type": "artist",
        "fqid": "mxm:artist:XXXXXXX"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Genre

The genres associated to a track are listed as an array like described here:

```json theme={null}
"genre": [
  {
    "id": 1076, //internal Musixmatch genre id
    "name": "Rap"
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "name": "Hip Hop/Rap"
  }
]
```

### Restrictions

Restrictions on content are applied for a number of reasons; however, it all comes down to preserving copyright owners and preventing legal queries.

Within every API response that includes lyrics or subtitles we're going to provide a territory based restriction data which will allows you to identify the countries you are allowed to display that content in.

It is imperative that the client applies the updates of the country-restriction data as soon as possible.
We expect these updates to happen ideally on the day the update is made available to you as they may, for example, include a restriction included as a result of a takedown notice.

This restriction block contains two sets, the allowed and the blocked countries:

* Countries are identified with the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard**
* **XW** Identifies every country

There are two different types of possible configurations:

1. All the world allowed with the exception of a specific set of countries (that is usually empty)

```json theme={null}
restrictions: { allowed: [XW], blocked: [] } 
```

This means you can display the lyrics in every country.

```json theme={null}
restrictions: { allowed: [XW], blocked: [US,CA] }
```

This means you can not display the lyrics in the USA and in Canada.
2\. 1. All the world is NOT allowed, with the exclusion of zero or few countries

```json theme={null}
restrictions: { allowed: [], blocked: [XW] } 
```

This means you can not display the lyrics in any country.

```json theme={null}
restrictions: { allowed: [IT], blocked: [XW] }
```

This means you can only display the lyrics in Italy.

## Data Delivery and Updates

### Full Data Feed

Musixmatch provides a full feed of its entire music metadata catalog once a week, typically on Tuesdays. This feed includes all available data fields for each track and serves as the base dataset for your integration.

* **Delivery Time**: Once a week
* **Use Case**: Use this feed to initialize your database or refresh the entire catalog in bulk.

### Daily Incremental Updates

In addition to the weekly full feed, Musixmatch offers **daily incremental updates**. These updates contain only the changes (additions, modifications, or deletions) made to the data since the last full feed. This is particularly useful for keeping your metadata synchronized without having to process the entire catalog daily.

* **Delivery Time**: Daily
* **Use Case**: Use this to keep your database updated with the latest changes in the metadata, reducing processing time and overhead.

A list of the **latest Musixmatch catalogue feeds to download** can be accessed using the API called [tracks.dump.get](/enterprises/catalog-feed/tracks-dump-get).


# track.dump.get
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/enterprises/catalog-feed/track-dump-get

get /ws/1.1/track.dump.get
Retrieve the track-related metadata for a single track in the json format (e.g., lyrics, writing credits, translations, mood information, syncs, etc).

<PlanIndicator />

The metadata returned are the same as in the catalogue feed.


# tracks.dump.get
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/enterprises/catalog-feed/tracks-dump-get

get /ws/1.1/tracks.dump.get
Retrieve a list of the latest Musixmatch catalog feeds to download.

<PlanIndicator />

The data returned comprises the download URLs for the catalog feeds starting from the latest full feed and therefore depends on the date when the request is made.
E.g., if the request is made on the day when the full feed was generated, then the response will contain only the link to the full feed. However, if it is made several days after, it will contain both the link to the full feed and the links to all the feeds with incremental updates generated since the last full feed.

# Distribution integration
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/enterprises/distribution/overview

Submit lyrics to Musixmatch from your distribution platform

When an artist releases music through your platform, getting their lyrics into Musixmatch means those lyrics appear across every product and service powered by Musixmatch data — from streaming apps to AI music experiences. The Distribution API gives you a direct, automated path to make that happen at scale.

## How it works

The integration is built around four resources: **artist claims**, **subscriptions**, **deliveries**, and **lyrics**.

An **artist claim** associates a Musixmatch user with their artist identity, using identifiers from Spotify, iTunes, or your own catalog. This is what allows Musixmatch to attribute delivered content to the right artist.

A **subscription** event notifies Musixmatch when a user subscribes to or unsubscribes from a plan on your platform. Musixmatch maps your plan identifiers to the corresponding Musixmatch plans and grants or revokes access accordingly.

A **delivery** is a release package — a ZIP file containing the ERN metadata and audio files for one release. Submitting a delivery makes the release known to Musixmatch and gives us the audio we need to generate time-synced lyrics.

A **lyrics submission** associates plain-text lyrics with a specific track, identified by ISRC. You can submit lyrics yourself if you have them, or leave it to Musixmatch to AI-generate them from the audio. Either way, the output is plain-text lyrics indexed in the Musixmatch catalog.

The two steps are independent by design — a delivery can arrive before lyrics are ready, and lyrics can be submitted as soon as they exist, even before release date. The only requirement is that a delivery containing the audio must be processed before AI generation can run.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register as a partner">
    Contact [apisupport@musixmatch.com](mailto:apisupport@musixmatch.com) to receive your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and partner base URL. You will also provide your `redirect_uri` for the OAuth flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Use the [Authorization Code flow](/enterprises/authentication#authorization-code-flow) to authenticate an artist in your app and retrieve their Musixmatch user ID. Use the [Client Credentials flow](/enterprises/authentication#client-credentials-flow) to obtain a service-level Bearer token for your backend API calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim the artist">
    Call `POST /distribution/artist/claim` with the user's Musixmatch user ID and at least one artist identifier (Spotify artist ID, iTunes artist ID, or your internal artist ID). Musixmatch returns a list of `claim_id`s confirming the association. Use `GET /distribution/artist/claim/{partner_user_id}` to verify the claim was processed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage subscriptions">
    Call `POST /distribution/subscriptions` when a user subscribes to a plan on your platform to activate their Musixmatch plan. Call `DELETE /distribution/subscriptions/{musixmatch_user_id}` when they unsubscribe to revoke access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deliver the release">
    Call `POST /distribution/deliveries/files` to get a pre-signed upload URL and a `file_id`. Upload the release ZIP to that URL, then call `POST /distribution/deliveries` with the `file_id` to create the delivery and receive a `delivery_id`. Poll `GET /distribution/deliveries/{delivery_id}` until the status is `completed`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit lyrics">
    Call `POST /distribution/lyrics` with the track ISRC and — optionally — the plain-text lyrics. If you omit the lyrics, Musixmatch AI-generates them from the audio in the delivery. Poll `GET /distribution/lyrics/{lyrics_request_id}` until the status is `success`, at which point the plain-text lyrics are indexed in the catalog.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Base URL

Each distribution partner is assigned a dedicated base URL during onboarding:

```
https://varco-{partner}.musixmatch.com
```

All Distribution API endpoints are served under this URL.

## Authentication

All Distribution API endpoints require a Bearer token obtained via the [Client Credentials flow](/enterprises/authentication#client-credentials-flow). The `POST` endpoints additionally require the artist's Musixmatch user ID, which you retrieve by introspecting the user's access token from the [Authorization Code flow](/enterprises/authentication#retrieving-the-musixmatch-user-id).


# Bulk Lyrics Submission

Standardized formats and methods for submitting lyrics in bulk to Musixmatch

## Documentation for Partners

This document outlines the standardized formats and methods for submitting lyrics in bulk to contribute lyrical content at scale.

**Last updated July 8, 2025**

## Overview of Accepted Formats

Musixmatch accepts lyrics submissions in several standardized formats to accommodate different partner workflows:

1. **CSV Musixmatch Standard Format** - Method for bulk lyrics delivery primarily suitable for labels
2. **JSONL Format** - Method for bulk lyrics delivery primarily suitable for labels
3. **DDEX MEAD** - For partners using industry standard DDEX protocols
4. **Synchronised lyrics** - Method for bulk time-synched lyrics delivery primarily suitable for labels
5. **Pre-released lyrics** - Method for bulk lyrics delivery prior to the release date, primarily suitable for labels

## Submission Process

1. **Initial Setup**: Contact Musixmatch filling [this form](https://musixmatch.typeform.com/to/kkbZwjvH) to establish credentials and delivery method
2. **Test Submission**: Send a small (100 tracks) batch for validation
3. **Feedback Integration**: Address any formatting issues identified
4. **Production Submission**: Begin regular delivery of properly formatted lyrics

## Best Practices

1. **Data Validation**: Ensure all ISRCs are valid and correctly formatted
2. **File Size**: Lyrics delivery should not exceed a maximum of 1000 ISRCs per batch/file
3. **Lyrics Transcription**: Ensure that the lyrics are transcribed as sung in the recording, following [Musixmatch transcription guidelines](https://community.musixmatch.com/guidelines?lng=en#transcribe)
4. **Lyrics Formatting**: Maintain original line breaks and paragraph structure
5. **Character Encoding**: Verify UTF-8 encoding to preserve special characters
6. **Regular Updates**: Establish a consistent schedule for delivering new content
7. **Communication**: Inform Musixmatch of significant changes to your delivery format

Note that internal staff may periodically review lyrics to maintain the quality standards required by DSPs, with no impact on content integrity.

## 1. CSV Standard Format for Lyrics Submission

### File Specifications

* **File naming convention**: `partnername_lyrics_YYYYMMDD.csv`
* **Format**: CSV file (not Excel)
* **Encoding**: UTF-8, with or without BOM
* **Delimiter**: Comma (,)
* **Quote character**: Double quote (")
  * Used to escape values containing delimiters
  * Example: `"Laser , Game", nice, 829`
* **Escape character**: Double quote (")
  * For escaping quoted values containing quotes
  * Example: `"We Will Rock You (From ""We Will Rock You"")"`

### Headers and Fields

Headers must appear in this exact order:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                 |

GBAAA9100070,Stars,John Doe,247000,en,A23,"Lyrics body in brackets 
command return to line break,
lorem ipsum"
GBAAA9100071,Luna,Jane Something,247001,es,A24,"Lyrics body in brackets 
command return to line break,
lorem ipsum"
```

## 2. JSONL Format

The [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) format, with each JSON object on a single line, is efficient for streaming and processing large datasets. Its line-by-line structure supports independent processing, simple appending, and efficient handling of bulk lyric submissions.

Below is a JSONL model that reflects the CSV standard format for lyrics submission.

### JSON Schema

```javascript theme={null}
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["isrc", "artist", "title", "lyrics"],
  "properties": {
    "isrc": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "International Standard Recording Code",
      "pattern": "^[A-Z]{2}-?[A-Z\\d]{3}-?\\d{2}-?\\d{5}$"
    },
    "artist": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the artist associated with the track"
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Title of the track"
    },
    "lyrics": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The lyrics as sung in the recording, following Musixmatch transcription guidelines"
    },
    "duration": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Integer representing track duration in milliseconds (e.g., 240000 for 4 minutes); fill in '0' if not available"
    },
    "language": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The expected language (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code)",
      "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z]{2}$"
    },
    "partner_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Partner internal identification number"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### JSONL Example with Single Lyrics

```json theme={null}
{"isrc":"ABCDE1234567","artist":"Artist Name","title":"Track Title","lyrics":"Lyrics line 1\nLyrics line 2\nLyrics line 3","duration":240000,"language":"en","partner_id":"PARTNER123"}
```

### JSONL Example with Multiple Lyrics

```json theme={null}
{"isrc":"ABCDE1234567","artist":"Artist Name","title":"Track Title","lyrics":"Lyrics line 1\nLyrics line 2\nLyrics line 3","duration":240000,"language":"en","partner_id":"PARTNER123"}
{"isrc":"FGHIJ8901234","artist":"Another Artist","title":"Another Track","lyrics":"More lyrics line 1\nMore lyrics line 2","duration":180000,"language":"fr","partner_id":"PARTNER124"}

```

## 3. DDEX Standard

For partners already using DDEX standards, Musixmatch accepts lyrics submissions via DDEX-MEAD and DDEX-ERN. Different DDEX formats should be agreed upon separately.

**The ISRC field is mandatory.**

### DDEX-MEAD 1.1

See [DDEX guidance on communicating lyrics](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/best-practices-for-all-ddex-standards/guidance-on-releaseresourcework-metadata/communicating-lyrics/).

**Embedded lyrics (ASCII text)** — plain-text lyrics embedded directly in the MEAD message using `Format="ASCII"`.

```xml theme={null}
<ResourceInformation>
  <ResourceSummary>
    <ResourceId><ISRC>ATUV71500090</ISRC></ResourceId>
  </ResourceSummary>
  <Lyrics>
    <Text Format="ASCII">Lyric line 1
Lyric line 2
Lyric line 3</Text>

    <LanguageAndScriptOfLyrics>en</LanguageAndScriptOfLyrics>
  </Lyrics>
</ResourceInformation>
```

### DDEX-ERN 3.7/3.8

In ERN, lyrics are delivered as a separate `<Text>` resource of type `LyricText`, then linked to the track via `<LinkedReleaseResourceReference LinkDescription="Lyrics">` in the release.

* **External `.txt` files** — plain-text lyrics referenced as an external file.
* **External `.ttml` files** — [TTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language) (Timed Text Markup Language), an XML-based format for timed text with support for synchronisation, styling, and positioning.
* **External `.lrc` files** — [LRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_\(file_format\)#Core_format) (LyRiCs), a plain-text format with time tags for synchronising lyrics with audio.

```xml theme={null}
<!-- In ResourceList: declare the lyrics as a Text resource -->
<Text>
  <TextType>LyricText</TextType>
  <ResourceReference>A5</ResourceReference>

</ResourceGroupContentItem>
```

## 4. **Synchronised lyrics**

Musixmatch supports several formats for the submission of synchronised lyrics, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration for our partners.

* [<u>LRC</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_\(file_format\)#Core_format)<u> </u>**(LyRiCs)** 

  The LRC format is a plain text file that contains time tags for synchronising lyrics with an audio file. It is widely used and easily editable, making it a popular choice for many contributors.
* [<u>TTML</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language)<u> </u>**(Timed Text Markup Language)** 

  TTML is an XML-based format designed for representing timed text information, such as captions and subtitles. It offers robust capabilities for complex synchronisation scenarios, including styling and positioning.

Please refer to your account manager to set up a dedicated flow.

## **5. Pre-released lyrics**

For lyrics submissions prior to the release date, a separate file with specific requirements is necessary.

Please refer to your account manager to set up a dedicated flow.

> This documentation is subject to updates as formats evolve. Partners will be notified of any significant changes to submission requirements.

# Musixmatch Pro API
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/getting-started

The Musixmatch Lyrics API allows you to get access to Musixmatch metadata about song lyrics and music.

## Getting started

The Musixmatch API is available to both selected partners and individual developers. Here are the steps to follow to complete the initial setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get in touch">
    If you're looking to use or display lyrics in your app or website, check out our  <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/pro/api/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=web&utm_content=introduction_link" title="Musixmatch API pricing">API pricing plans</a> or <a href="#">send us an enquiry</a> for custom solutions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your API Key">
    Once you're registered, you'll receive your **API key** — a mandatory parameter for most API calls. It's your personal identifier and should be kept secret.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate with your product">
    With your API key in hand, you can start integrating Musixmatch into your app or website. Please follow our [implementation guidelines](/implementation-guidelines).
    Our team may contact you to review your implementation and ensure it complies with our content policy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Check the API terms

Once you have completed the initial setup, don't forget to take a look at the [API Terms & Conditions](https://about.musixmatch.com/apiterms) and the [Privacy Policy](https://about.musixmatch.com/privacy-policy).

We’ve worked hard to make this service completely legal so that we are all protected from any foreseeable liability: take the time to read this stuff.

*Not sure about something?*\
*Write us at* [sales@musixmatch.com](mailto:sales@musixmatch.com)

### Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, you need to include your API key as a query parameter in every call. Add the `apikey` parameter to your requests like this:

```http theme={null}
GET /ws/1.1/track.get?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you believe your API key has been compromised, contact us immediately at [sales@musixmatch.com](mailto:sales@musixmatch.com).

<Warning>
  Requests without a valid API key will receive a `401` error response.
</Warning>

### Start the integration on your product

In the most common scenario you only need to implement two API calls:

1. Match your catalog to ours using the search function as described [track.search](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-search) page
2. Get the lyrics using the [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get) API call. That’s it!

We can also provide static samples to let you see how the data will look like.

We can’t wait to see the amazing things you’re going to do with the Musixmatch API!

# Implementation guidelines
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/implementation-guidelines



Before going on, we recommend to read the checklist throughout, and make sure everything is implemented.

Our API has been carefully thought out to let your creativity prevail over technology. There are literally thousands of applications that can be built using the lyrics API, but first you need to have an understanding of the basic principles in order to decide what calls to use.

It is important to distinguish between searching and matching:

* **Searching** is straightforward enough: make a call with the parameters that you are seeking and receive the response. See details in [track.search](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-search)
* **Matching** is a different matter and is used when you already have your own music catalog and want to associate licensed lyrics with each track. The most effective match is possible using the [ISRC](https://isrc.ifpi.org/en/), if it’s not possible, we suggest to use the metadata (Artist and Title) ranking the most effective result by popularity. See details in [matcher.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/matcher-lyrics-get)

## Searching or browsing music

If you don’t have your own music catalog you’ll probably want to search our database to deliver results to your users.

Here are some typical functions to implement:

* Get most popular lyrics and artists with: [chart.tracks.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/chart-tracks-get), [chart.artists.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/chart-artists-get)
* Let users search directly for their favorite lyrics with: [track.search](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-search), [artist.search](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/artist-search)
* Simply get lyrics with: [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get)
* Get info about an album with: [album.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/album-get)

## Matching your music catalog

If you have your own music service and browsing feature, you can focus on matching our lyrics to your catalog.\
We recommend using the ISRC ID to match the correct track, and falling back to the track title and artist name when the ISRC is not available. In some cases, due to contractual agreements, we also provide the client’s track identifier in our catalog. In such cases, the best practice is to prioritize that identifier when matching.

When matching time-synced lyrics to your tracks, keep in mind that there may be multiple versions of the lyrics, each associated with a specific duration. Choose the one that most closely matches your track’s duration.\
\
Reccomended API methods:

* Match your song against our database with: [matcher.track.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/matcher-track-get)
* Then get the lyrics with: [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get)

## Displaying lyrics

* Display lyrics making sure to add the [lyrics views tracking](/lyrics-views-tracking) and the copyright info from the `lyrics_copyright` field received from [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-get)
* In case you’re showing time-synced lyrics use the [track.subtitle.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-subtitle-get)
* Apply content restrictions based on [country restrictions](/content-restrictions) rules
* Add the "Lyrics powered by" image [provided by Musixmatch](https://about.musixmatch.com/brand-resources) and link to the lyrics page on Musixmatch website using the `backlink_url` field received from [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get)

## Tracking API calls

If you are accessing the Musixmatch Catalog via API, you can log in to your dashboard at [developer.musixmatch.com](https://developer.musixmatch.com/login) and track all the API calls you are currently using on your product.

# Lyrics views tracking
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/lyrics-views-tracking



Whether you access the catalog via API or feed, you are required to track the lyrics usage/views.

## Views tracking for Catalog access via API

### Tracking URLs implementation

When displaying any type of content, you are required to include in your page/application one of the two available tracking system:

#### 1. JavaScript for websites

Get the URL returned into the field `script_tracking_url` from the [track.lyrics.get](/api-reference/lyrics-catalog/track-lyrics-get) api response and include it as script tag.

```javascript theme={null}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/AMa6hJCIEzn1v8RuOP">
```

#### 2. Image pixel

Include the URL returned into the field pixel\_tracking\_url as an image src when it’s not possible to use the script.

```html theme={null}
<img src="http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/AMa6hJCIEzn1v8RuXW">
```

Furthermore, every time a lyrics is present in a page the lyrics\_copyright field must also be clearly visible.

## Views tracking for Catalog Feed access

In case you access the catalog via feed, you’ll need to provide back a usage report on a monthly basis.

The lyrics usage report must comply to the technical specifications that will be provided to you once the service terms are agreed on.


# Musixmatch metadata
Source: https://docs.musixmatch.com/musixmatch-metadata



The Musixmatch API is built around lyrics, but there are many other data we provide through the API that can be used to improve every existent music service:

* **Track**: the main entity to which data is associated
* **Artist**: associated with the track
* **Album**: the album to which the track belongs

Let's explore the data we provide with some suggestion on how to use them for every single API object.

## Track

Inside the track object you can get the following extra information:

#### Track Rating

The track rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is a song in Musixmatch.\
You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular songs of an artist, of a music genre, of a lyrics language.

#### Instrumental and Explicit flags

The instrumental flag identifies songs with music only, no lyrics.\
The explicit flag identifies songs with explicit lyrics or explicit title. We're able to identify explicit words and set the flag for the most common languages.

#### Music Genre

The music genere of the song.\
Can be used to group songs by genre, as input for similarity algorithms, artist genre identification, navigate songs by genere, etc.

#### Song titles translations

The track title, as translated in different languages, can be used to display the right writing for a given user, example:

* LIES (Bigbang) becomes 在光化門 in Chinese
* HALLELUJAH (Bigbang) becomes ハレルヤ in Japanese

#### Understanding Track Id's

Every track has two distinct IDs:

* `track_id`: identifies a track within an album. The same song of the same artist may appear in a Single Album or Ep, then in the official Album, then in a "Live concert". All this tracks will have distinct Id's so you can build the Artist → Album → Tracks relation.
* `commontrack_id`: to link a track to its lyrics, syncs and music publishing information we group many track Id's into a single commontrack\_id. Tracks with same `commontrack_id` will share the same lyrics.

#### Example response from the API

            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Artist

Inside the artist object you can get the following extra information:

#### Comments and country

An artist comment is a short snippet of text which can be mainly used for disambiguation.
The artist country is the born country of the artist/group.

There are two perfect search result if you search by artist with the keyword "U2".

Indeed there are two distinct music groups with this same name, one is the most known irish group of Bono Vox, the other is a less popular (world wide speaking) group from Japan.

Here's how you can made use of the artist comment in your search result page:

* U2 (Irish rock band)
* U2 (あきやまうに)

You can also show the artist country for even better disambiguation:

* U2 (Irish rock band) from Ireland
* U2 (あきやまうに) from Japan

#### Artist translations

When you create a world wide music related service you have to take into consideration to display the artist name in the user's local language. These translation are also used as aliases to improve the search results.

Let's use PSY for this example: western people know him as PSY but Koreans want to see the original name 싸이. Using the name translations provided by our API you can show to every user the writing they expect to see. Furthermore, when you search for "psy gangnam style" or "싸이 gangnam style" with our search/match API you will still be able to find the song.

#### Artist rating

The artist rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an artist in Musixmatch.
You can use this information to build charts, for suggestions, to sort search results. In the example above about U2, we use the artist rating to show the irish band before the Japanese one in our serp.

#### Artist music genre

We provide one or more main artist genre, this information can be used to calculate similar artist, suggestions, or the filter a search by artist genre.

#### Example response from the API

```json theme={null}
{
  "message": {
    "header": {
      "status_code": 200,
      "execute_time": 0.071532011032104
    },
    "body": {
      "artist": {
        "artist_id": 118,
        "artist_name": "Queen",
        "artist_country": "GB",
        "artist_alias_list": [
          {
            "artist_alias": "\u5973\u738b"
          }
        ],
        "artist_rating": 91,
        "artist_twitter_url": "",
        "updated_time": "2012-06-11T08:19:15Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Album

Inside the album object you can get the following nice extra information:

#### Album Rating

The album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in Musixmatch.
You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.

#### Album copyright and label

For most of our albums we can provide extra information like for example:

* Label: Universal-Island Records Ltd.
* * Copyright: (P) 2013 Rubyworks, under license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment.

#### Album type and release date

The album official **release date** can be used to sort an artist's albums view starting by the most recent one.
Album can also be filtered or grouped by **type**: Single, Album, Compilation, Remix, Live. This can help to build an artist page with a more organized structure.

#### Album music genre

For most of the albums we provide two groups of music genres. Primary and secondary.\
This information can be used to help user navigate albums by genre.

An example could be:

* Primary genere: POP
* Secondary genre: K-POP or Mandopop
